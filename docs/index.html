			<h3>Info & Questions</h3>
			<h6>Why was BSC-BPM Created?</h6>
			<b><p>BSC-BPM was created to be basically the <u>sequel</u> to BPM. This is because the original BPM was written in python, and since I was trying to learn more and more about C, I thought it would be a good idea to rewrite it in C. Also, the old python BPM had to be hard-coded into whatever shell was using it. Since C could be easily compiled into an executable file, it was perfect since all I had to do was use argv for the arguments, instead of splitting and input, and all of that inefficient stuff that I had to do in the Python version. This also makes the code shorter and easier to maintain. The code for Bear-Shell (Python) was very hard to maintain since it was super long. However, I still work on it from time to time, that includes BearShellC. Updates have just been slow since I'm focusing on BSC-BPM more.</p></b>
